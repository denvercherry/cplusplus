Summarize the project and what problem it was solving:

This project allowed users to view a clock in military and standard time. It allowed users to add additional hours, minutes and seconds to the clock. 

What did you do particularly well?

I felt I handled the user menu well and the data validation entry.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I could create a functions cpp file and created a class to store the clock information. 

Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

Working with new time object was initially challenging. I utlimately reviewed geeks4geeks.com and stackoverflow forums to troubleshoot. There's a large development community and people have run into similar problems. I was able to apply concepts dicussed in the forms to work for my project.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

The main skill I got from this was data validation and while logic. Data validation and loops are important pieces that are frequently used in programming. Anytime there is user input, I'll see me using validation techniques to verify the input.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I used the formatting spacing best practices which results in a very readable code. I also used several functions to make it more modularized so it can be adapted for other use cases.
